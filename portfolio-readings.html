                        Honestly, I agree with what Greg said in class — he is kind of weird. However, I do think some of the things he talked about made sense such that he explored how networks and art interact. Here, he explained postal systems as more of the support system and that the essence of mail art is incorporating creative media in that system instead of other distribution systems similar to how a canvas supports a painting. Subsequently, the postal system becomes a functional and intentional element within the piece which just happens to have its own predefined set of rules which I think is quite interesting!

                            I never really fully thought about how websites changed. For the longest time, I thought of the transformation of websites in relation to simply evolving technologies and tools for web design and development, so it was interesting to see that the growth of the internet can be somewhat attributed towards things like social media, a growing need for commercialization, and the desire for individual expression. In such a way, I agree with the text that, through websites, individuals become both author and architects who create not just content but form the space in which this content exists, especially for artists who stress individual agency through their personal websites. Side note but I also just really enjoyed the almost whimsical digital drawings throughout the text! It made the internet feel even more like this sort of foreign abstraction.<br>
    
                            <br>Some questions I thought of during this were:
                            
                            <br>1. Are there any ethical implications for the commercialization of the web? What are the tradeoffs we make between progress versus individual expression and creativity?
                            
                            <br>2. How can the web evolve further? We've talked about the web quite a bit in relation to its history, but what's our vision for it in the future?

                        <div class="content">
                        Given that the internet is constantly evolving, I think that we often neglect the idea of the early web and the limited resources available. I think it's interesting to think of how the internet has changed so much from being a place for individuals and small communities to create and own their own content before social media and standardized methods for UI design came in. In some paradoxal way, I think that the constraints of the early web allowed for better creativity and self-expression, forcing users to find innovative ways to create, share, and express themselves. At the same time, I think that we've become overly reliant on the internet as a digital archive so it was a bit jarring to have a reminder that our digital presence and legacies are often at the mercy of online platforms, especially as new technologies emerge and old ones fade away.         
                        <br>Questions for discussion:
                        <br>1. What concerns are there surrounding the preservation of our individual and collective digital memory?
                        <br>2. Is it really important for things on the internet to be permanent? Or doesn't it make sense for something to be impermanent in order for us to treasure it more?

                            I think that this reading comes at a good time as we're about to start making our own website. The writer discussed how in a "post digital" world, we have to think beyond simply print vs digital and explore how the mediums can actually complement each other. In a way, I suppose the websites we'll be making in class will function as a digital zine, incorporating traditional self-publishing practices within a modern space that's grounded on networks and new possibilities. 
                            
                            Discussion questions:
                            
                            1. The author talks about hybrid art and how it challenges notions of what a book or artwork can be. Can a website function as a book and/or artwork? Can it do both simultaneously? 
                            
                            2. How do we think the future of publishing will look? Will the fact that print is becoming more highly valued as a 'collectible' lead to a shift back to traditional print or will publishing shift completely to a digital space? Will this also apply to artists' self-publishing?

                            I found it interesting how they compared alt-text to translation, and it made me curious as to what is lost versus gained as we translate images to text. Perhaps we're even able to add extra meaning through word choices, our tone and focus, thereby opening new avenues for creativity & expression for artists. However, I do think that we need to be mindful of our obligation to inclusivity and equity as we create alt-text given that these were intended for those who are visually challenged. As such, accessibility needs to be a part of the creative process rather than an afterthought. 
    
                            Discussion Questions:
    
                            1. Do we have an ethical obligation to provide alternative text? Does providing alternative text take away from creative interpretations by providing viewers with some subtle guidance on what they're viewing?
    
                            2. How accurately can we describe images? Does it matter if these descriptions are objective versus subjective, especially when alt-text is used to describe art?

                            This reading made me think a lot about how universal technology or anything really is. I think that we often think of English as the closest to a universal language in the world that we forget who gets left out as we create systems and tools. Even the use of the english alphabet and subsequent misrepresentations of non-latin scripts contribute towards their minimized usage as time goes on. I liked that Nasser noted that this is a form of cultural violence in that it reduces non-english languages to cultural props rather than legitimate forms of communication.

                            1. Can technology ever be neutral or is it always a product of the culture that created it?
                            
                            2. Is it possible to decolonize technology? If so, will / should we take this course of action at the possible cost of progress?

                            I've taken psychology classes previously so it's interesting to actually think about how graphic design leverages the Gestalt theory instead of just intuitively using it in design. In relation to web design, it helps to understand how principles like proximity, similarity, and closure shape our perception of visual information, offering ways to design more cohesive and intuitive experiences rather than focusing solely on individual elements. 
    
                            A part that I liked a lot was the discussion of apparent movement and how we fill in the gaps between discrete frames to create a sense of motion. I think there's possibilities to explore this further in web design to possibly make smarter designs for things like animations and transitions. 
                            
                            Discussion questions:
                            
                            1. How might the idea of "the whole being different from the sum of its parts" challenge traditional approaches to web design, such as modular design systems?
                            
                            2. Is simplicity always necessarily better? Do things necessarily need to be coherent in a web-based setting?

                            I think it was interesting to see the discussion on "poetics of absence," how her work highlights what’s missing in digital interactions rather than just celebrating what’s there. I think her usage of the teleconferencing tech to sort of pass an imaginary string between cities reminded me a lot of calls nowadays and how it can make me sometimes feel detached despite the purpose of calls being to provide a method for connection. I suppose this goes back to her emphasis on pauses and the way people on-screen feel both present and ghostly. In a way, this made me think more about how tech doesn't necessarily save us from loneliness or forgetting, but art could turn those flaws into something hauntingly beautiful.
    
                            Questions:
                            1. We talk a lot about how web design often obsesses over seamless UX and how artists use websites for creative expression, but is it possible to treat loading screens, broken links, or even 404 errors as poetic moments? 
                            
                            2. Is everything online worth preserving? Doesn't letting something fade away add onto its story or give it more significance?

                            I think that the text offers an interesting view to examine how digital publishing and network culture are reshaping creativity, communication, and power dynamics. I think it's interesting to think that publishing was originally liked to physical acts and how interruption was central to grabbing attention. However, with new UX and UI design, I also sometimes feel that many things simply feel the same. We often here the notion that nothing is ever new and there are no original thoughts anymore but I think this is likely linked to the fact that continuous feeds are meant to feel like endless, ambient flows like discussed in the text. In that way, interruption and active attention is replaced by endless consumption and "new boredom." In such a way, digital platforms foster passive-yet-engaged participation at the cost of real meaningful interaction. 
    
                            Questions:
    
                            1. Can art disrupt the feed's addictive flow, or does it inevitably become part of the noise?
    
                            2. How might artists collaborate with designers to create "uncomfortable" interfaces that defy feed logic?

                            I don't necessarily know if I agree with Groy's argument completely because I do agree that the internet forces to acknowledge the mechanisms surrounding the presentation of art (screens, platforms, interfaces, etc.) because I think that it allows for new ways of immersion & disbeliefs not too different from museums and theaters (but in one's private space / more mobile ways). I do like his point though about how the lines between art and documentation starts to get blurred with the internet and how creativity nowadays seems heavily dependent on the data that artists are able to access. Tangentially, I wonder as well if individual creativity might be getting hindered by the fact that a lot of online platforms that artists rely on sort of act as an echo chamber such that we're only exposed to content that algorithms will appeal to us, thereby giving us less exposure to ideas that actually challenge / engage us meaningfully as artists.

                            1. Is it possible to create art online that resists becoming just another datapoint especially with the rise of AI?
                            
                            2. Are designs today feeding into the algorithmic gaze? how is creativity and the process towards idea generation changing with algorithms?
